## 📌 Conclusion

The correlation between education and unemployment in Asia is **non-linear** and **context-specific**. While some countries benefit from higher education in reducing unemployment, others (like India) face the challenge of **educated but unemployed** youth. Policymakers must go beyond the assumption that education alone guarantees employment.
